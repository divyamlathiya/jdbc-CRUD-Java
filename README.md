## Code Overview  

This project covers the implementation of CRUD operations using **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**. It provides examples and templates to help you:  

- Establish a connection with a database.  
- Execute SQL queries to create, retrieve, update, and delete records.  
- Understand the structure and execution flow of JDBC code in Java.

### Key Concepts Covered  

- Setting up `JDBC Drivers` and Connection Strings.  
- Writing `SQL queries` for `CRUD operations`.  
- Handling exceptions and errors in database operations.  
- Structuring Java code for clean and modular `JDBC implementation`.  

By the end of this project, you will be able to:  

- Build Java applications that connect to a database.  
- Write efficient and secure code for data manipulation.  
- Handle database exceptions and optimize query execution.
